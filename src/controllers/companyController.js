/*
  Unless it's a niche route that is needed I usually follow 
  the below pattern for controller methods:

  index: get list resource
  show: get specific resource
  create: create new resource
  update: update/edit specific resource
  destroy: delete specific resource
*/

export const index = async (req, res) => {}

export const show = async (req, res) => {}
